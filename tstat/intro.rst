Introduction
------

In this document, we'll explain how we handled passive monitoring on a network. Passive monitoring is network monitoring in which there isn't any traffic generated by the monitoring system. This document will start by an explanation of the sofware we used to performed monitoring and in which network configuration it was used. We'll then explore some use case where passive monitoring can be usefull, such as traffic classification and QoS evaluation. Finally, we'll try to summarize what we learned from this project in order to facilitate further attempt to passively monitor networks.
